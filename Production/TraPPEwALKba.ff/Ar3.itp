;     Simulations using this force field should be performed with a spherical cutoff of 14 Ã… and analytic tail corrections for the Lennard-Jones interactions.
;     The Ewald summation should be used for Coulomb interactions.
;     The standard TraPPE nonbonded potential (uNB shown above) is calculated for all intermolecular interactions and those intramolecular interactions involving (pseudo)atoms separated by four or more bonds.
;     Intramolecular 1-4 Lennard-Jones and Coulomb interactions are excluded.
